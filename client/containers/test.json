Super friendly staff, affordable drinks and great music. Highly recommend Beacon to anyone who is in Denver and hasn't been! It's always a good time and attracts a nice genuine crowd!","Neat little bar places perfectly around other great attractions. The decor is my favorite part, great place to take some cool photos with friends. The music is great as well, love to come dancing here! If you have friends from out of town I'd recommend bringing them here.","We came for drinks after 9pm!The atmosphere is really fun! There are several rooms that are all linked together where you can hang out and a bigger room with a DJ and dance floor.The back patio is where it's at! There's a fire pit, and tables and chairs for chillin. The bartenders and staff are also very friendly! I liked the vibes and would definitely come back for the atmosphere!","I was walking over to a near by brewery when I stumbled upon this place. I had no idea what it was and walked in to check it out. The bartender welcomed us in and was super friendly. The place has a few rooms that are designed by one or multiple artists. They do have shows here and even have a pretty big dance floor. This place is super fun, very artsy and kind of feels like you're in a different world. We did stop in super early 6pm and there was hardly anyone there. But this allowed us to be in the honey room and it was nice to have to ourselves as it is pretty small.","This place is so unique and eclectic, which each room having a different vibe. The rooms are somewhat small though and make it hard to socialize.  We went kinda early in the night like around 8:45pm. They started charging a cover at 9pm, so we did miss that. We were at the main bar inside, which is pretty poorly placed. Its close to the entryway, so it gets crowded, and there isn't much space to stand in line and wait without literally getting stuck with branches from the decorations. There was also a DJ playing loud electronic music in front of a fairly empty dance floor. I don't know if this place really is in tune with what it's identity is as a bar. It was a cool place to walk through, see once, and probably never return to as it didn't really feel like a functional place to hang out with friends and meet people.","The only reason I was generous enough to leave two stars is because the event space is actually super cool and gives a trippy/artsy vibe. The lack of the other stars is for the managers bragging about girls getting roofied at their club and the drinks being piss poor and over priced. Will never return and advise everyone who does to watch themselves!","This place is so much fun! You walk in and instantly feel like you're in another world. Think electric forest vibez!  The dance floor is a place where you can just be yourself and get silly. Great dance music and a sweet outdoor area out back to chill and hang out with friends. Everything is art focused and very visually appealing. The people that go here don't take themselves too seriously from what I have experienced which is a nice vibe to be in overall.","This place sounded super cool so I was excited to check it out, unfortunately the experience wasn't what it was hyped up to be. The bouncer at the front door was on a serious power trip. He was being so ridiculous and not letting anyone in and talking a bunch of crap. We were a very non-rowdy respectable group of people just trying to get in so there was no reason for him to be acting this way. At first I thought he was just kidding around and trying to be funny but then I realized he was being serious. It got to the point where the manager (maybe it was the owner?) came over to see what was going on because no one was coming in and he realized the bouncer was being ridiculous and the manager made the bouncer leave the front door. Luckily the manager was cool and let us all in with no problem. The bouncer really put a sour taste in my mouth the rest of the night. I will say the decor inside was very cool. It definitely felt a bit like Tulum. The layout of the place is a bit weird and not super functional. The bar is long and kinda in a hallway right at the entrance so when it got crowded it was difficult to get a drink and hard to just get inside since you have to fight through a crowded path. It took forever to get a drink. The bartenders were nice enough but they needed help. The outside area in the back was pretty cool. Most of the night we hung out by the fire pits out there. The two \"secret\" back rooms were cool but at one point one of the art installations fell over and knocked a large heavy stool into me which didn't feel good. If you are going to have a bar with art, make sure it is secured well to the walls or ground! Overall, the experience was meh. It's a go once and see it, take a picture, and prob never go again place. Kinda gave me frat party vibes.","This is a phenomenal bar to hang out at! Everyone is super friendly! The place is very clean and we loved how artsy it is. The owners of the bar are very friendly! I would definitely recommend to anyone in the area to stop by! Ben and I got married here and couldn't be happier with how everything came out! Thank you  for everything!","The community you want to spend time with in an awesome location, full of cool art pieces and welcoming vibes","6.4 miles away from The Beacon"],"averageScore":0.7294375},{"id":"a1SV0WCwN-Ufy1F3BOg8Ew","name":"The Mansion on Colfax","image_url":"https://s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/nU5qMUFWzYr1prWO6b5jEg/o.jpg","url":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-mansion-on-colfax-denver-4?adjust_creative=jwV6sY1jtf2pWAyq1ig0sQ&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=jwV6sY1jtf2pWAyq1ig0sQ","categories":[{"alias":"cocktailbars","title":"Cocktail Bars"},{"alias":"tacos","title":"Tacos"},{"alias":"sandwiches","title":"Sandwiches"}],"location":["1509 N Marion St","Denver, CO 80218"],"comments":[],"averageScore":null},{"id":"e1bAJ7DIYL953AsMer9Q-g","name":"Yacht Club","image_url":"https://s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/9eaZjHfu2mHAkyoAJnse_w/o.jpg","url":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/yacht-club-denver?adjust_creative=jwV6sY1jtf2pWAyq1ig0sQ&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=jwV6sY1jtf2pWAyq1ig0sQ","categories":[{"alias":"cocktailbars","title":"Cocktail Bars"},{"alias":"hotdog","title":"Hot Dogs"}],"location":["3701 N Williams St","Denver, CO 80205"],"comments":["3701 N Williams St","Denver, CO 80205","2.1 miles away from Yacht Club","Yelp users haven’t asked any questions yet about Yacht Club.","Your trust is our top concern, so businesses can't pay to alter or remove their reviews.

Look for nautical knot on door and flag hanging outside or better yet, you can find it next to Brassieres restaurant.Staff are friendly. Ambience is a bit kitschy in a good way. Venue is small and packed which is part of the ambience.The drinks are fantastic. I don't usually order cocktails because I like my drinks more spirit forward, but this place pours a well balanced drink with top shelf alcohol! Such a great cocktail bar with an inclusive and fun vibe.","4.5 stars. How have I not heard of this adorable cocktail bar within walking distance of my house? Probably because it used to be located in the Source Hotel. Now it's attached to Brasserie Brixton (which I've been meaning to visit) and relatively easy to find if you recognize the nautical logo. Yacht Club gets busy quickly after opening at 4pm, so arrive early! Love that it's one of what seems like a few places actually available in Denver on Mondays.Lots of delicious, colorful cocktails with high quality ingredients. I ordered a strawberry daiquiri which I thought was frozen, but maybe I misspoke. Still tasty and boozy. The vibes are EVERYTHING, from Les Miserables projecting on the far wall to the staff laughing with each other. The Yacht Club menu mentions inclusivity as one of their values, and that's exactly what I felt. So many more drinks I can't wait to try, in addition to the separate menu of hot dogs.","Dope bar. There's no sign in front letting you know if you're at the right place or not. But if you hear music, then chances are you've found this place. Located next to Brixton, the Yacht Club is a local and industry watering hole. No dart board or pool table here, just cool peeps and stellar hot dogs. Yep, you read that right. Hot dogs...","Wow. This place is terrific. The vibe is super chill and super fun. The drinks are spot on. The music is fire. Amazing!","If you're ever in the mood for a really, really, really good hotdog and a beer/shot combo this is your place! We had a mix of all different variations of the dogs and I can say they were all pretty amazing! The elote dog of the day should probably become a menu staple because I would def make a trip back quite often for it. Also, service was great- our guy had such a positive attitude and made us feel very welcome. 5 out of 5 stars for sure!","Great vibe and great drinks what can I say!  Lauren pitched a drink that sounded like a ranch flavored martini, I'm not into either.   With the first sip they had my complete trust, so should they have yours.","Such a solid place to grab a nice drink in the rino/Cole neighborhood. It's like a modern Cheers type scenario but with a killer cocktail menu. They clearly love the neighborhood and the people and they really like to make connections with their patrons. I love going there cause the bartending crew is just good people and remember you. Oh and the have THE BEST hotdogs. Amazing Cocktails + Legit Hot Dogs? Sold.","The raw bar, service and cocktails were good, but I can't get over the clutter and lack of cleanliness at this bar. The open \"kitchen\" is in the middle of the wrap around bar so you see everything that goes on. Before I was about to sit down to the left of my friend I moved to his right to avoid the sticky cocktail remnants and giant smear of who knows what. Obviously, this would be acceptable if I was taking another customer's seat, but the bar was completely empty, so what's the excuse?Also, I get that The Source is a hipster hangout but these two employees were getting a little too comfortable with one another with the words they were exchanging in front of us. I would have also preferred that they not be eating sausage behind the bar, but maybe that's just me. Separately, they have a deep fryer and a hot plate in the middle of the bar so you'll likely end up leaving smelling like whatever they're cooking.","Go to The Source a lot but have never been to the bar in the middle.  Been to the all the venues around there.  But we went on a Saturday and we sat in the middle because we were with a friend who didn't drink beer.  We ordered a few beers and she was able to order liquor that she could have.The bartenders were very friendly.  They had a good selection of beer on draft and bottle.  Def a hip spot to go to.Will def go back! Cheers.","Can't speak to anything here except the oysters but they were fabulous!! They came with shredded horseradish, a little shot glass of hot sauce and an eye dropper bottle of another sauce. The joint is more of a large bar in the middle of the source and also serves food in the brewery. We had a selection of oysters while drinking beer at crooked staveSo good.

The Passionate Love is a yummy dark chocolate mousse outer layer with passion fruit filling and a chocolate cake interior. I would recommend trying this one! The Tulip taste more like vanilla than mango with raspberry filling. It was good but not my favorite. Matcha rose latte is as expected.The place was busy but the wait wasn't particularly long. There was seating outside and downstairs inside.","Jonquils is a cute cafe & bakery located on 135 Newbury Street in Copley. The bakery specializes in geometric shaped cakes made with 3-D printed molds. Not surprising for the owner who was a former architect turned pastry chef. Grab your favorite drink and a specially designed sponge cake. There is plenty of seating by the stairs or lower level. In my opinion, the best seating is by the stairs leading to the lower level. The lower level is located where the cafe's restroom is and it gets a lot of foot traffic not just from patrons but also people walking through Newberry Street. The hot matcha rose latte is my favorite drink order. I have yet to try the iced version but I am sure it's a beauty with the green color from the matcha and the pink for the rose milk. Complete this with a soft sponge cake. There are so many unique creations if you come early. See my pictures.","These desserts are so cute and delicious! 3D printed desserts are so much fun to look at and would be a great surprise for a dinner party. I tried the Tropical Sphere, Twisted Love and the Geometric Apple. All three were light and airy w/ amazing flavor. The Hibiscus tea was refreshing and a great treat for my morning walk in the sun. I can't wait to try all of the other flavors!","Very cool cafe that 3D prints their desserts!I was visiting Boston and a friend recommended I come check out this spot. The cakes are all so pretty!

The food was delicious and I especially enjoyed the chicken salad sandwich and the scone with jam. As for sweets, the brownie was especially delicious and the cookies were so cute. The staff were so nice and attentive and the indoor cafe area is beautifully decorated. Definitely a good place to go for a special occasion or for a nice little treat.

General Hospital (MGH), down to Beacon Street near the Public Garden -- turn and continue on Beacon toward Copley Square, and you can walk over to the Bull & Finch Pub, the inspiration/setting for the fictional Cheers television show.  So if you are walking Charles Street, the Beacon Hill Bookstore and Cafe, is closer to the MGH end of Charles Street, and if you are familiar right near, The Sevens, another more local and beloved pub.This location was formerly a well known Hungarian restaurant, with apartments above, which is standard for Charles Street and many areas of the city -- retail or restaurants on the ground floor, then apartments or offices on the upper floors.  Also want to note, I left my office around 12:30 and did a short walk over to Charles Street, and despite the cloudy day, it was warm and it was in the midst of the weekend brunch-lunch time.  So the street was busy especially with younger twenty-somethings out and about, and the bookstore was quite crowded just walking in the doorway.The building was completely gutted and updated, there is a cafe located in the lower or garden level, which makes sense again from the history of the building housing the previous restaurant. To note, I did not visit there. To reach the bookstore, you must walk up a flight of stairs -- again that townhouse or brownstone feeling is already set. There was a small hall and entry way, with a bamboo coat rack or vanity on the wall to the right.  The walls, the bookcases, and the staircase to the next floor are all painted white.  Generally the rooms were feeling narrow so I think this is a good choice to try to maximize or allude to more space.  The ground floor has a clerk/desk right by the stair case, next to the desk is an elevator.  The ground floor is a mix of general interest and cook books near the front.  It was charming and cheerful, and I was happy for them to see so many people but I decided to take the elevator and go up to the second floor.   Their logo/mascot is a squirrel with an acorn sitting on a stack of books, and so by the front windows to the left they section of merchandise with their name/squirrel logo, tee shirts, tote bags, and little toys, etc. The elevator was also a bit small, it was new but reminded me of older elevators/older buildings and they did the trick of a mirror on the back wall.  It worked fine but if you tend to be claustrophobic you probably should opt for the stairs.  The second floor was fiction, nonfiction and poetry.  Tables run down the middle of the floor with suggested/popular titles.  There again was a large ground so I did not venture too much further.  There was a side room with specific titles or interests, I will have to check out on a different visit.  Also I did not make up to the top floor where there are children's books and young adult section, so I cannot comment on them yet.  Instead I walked down the stairs back to the ground floor and got in line to check out.  Actually I had a gift card and there is some balance left.  The cashier was nice asked me if I needed a bag (Boston ordinance) and gave me a book mark along with my slip.Looking forward to coming back here, hopefully during a quieter time, when I can roam a bit more freely. #shoplocal #shopindie #supportyourindiebookstore","I absolutely love the Beacon Hill area and I feel like this bookstore and cafe truly encapsulates the ambiance of the neighborhood! I tried the 71 Chèvre and The Franklin sandwich, and let me tell you, they fancify the simplest sandwiches but in the best way possible! They were absolutely scrumptious! The vibes of both the patio and inside dining area were also absolutely beautiful, I felt like I was playing the role of a small town girl in a big production film. Even the small touches of the servers giving you a blanket outside really added to the experience! The bookstore itself was also beautifully constructed and designed. Each floor had its own little charm to it that I loved, especially the children's section! It was so magical seeing books from your childhood coming to life as a train went around the ceiling of the area! I feel like I could spend hours here looking around so as a word of caution: make sure you allot enough time for yourself to truly take it all in and enjoy the magic of this wonderful bookstore!","My wife and stumbled across this delightful little cafe while exploring the Black Heritage Trail in Boston. It's almost fair tale in appearance. I love walking down the narrow passageway to get to it. We did not have a reservation, but they had space at their counter. Thee seating was tight with the other couple who sat next to me. We bumped each other a few times. The interior is gorgeous. It's so tastefully done with the perfect design, colors, decor, etc. Service was good. The menu is extremely limited. We each had the lemon chicken soup. It came in its own covered cup with simulated piece of a page torn from a book. Amazing detail!  The soup was outstanding. It was hearty, filled with real pulled-off-the-bone chicken, and just a slight hint of lemon. Since we shared the sandwich, they cheerfully separated the meal onto two plates. The chicken curry sandwich was a bit disappointingly bland for a curry. It was good though. We would most definitely return to try other items.","Got breakfast here on a Saturday. We got the Charles. It was pretty small but tasty. Eggs cooked to perfection with sweet jammy onions.  The service was ok. I asked for ketchup and he laughed at the request. Apparently they are too fancy for ketchup.","I didn't get to try the cafe, no reservations were available. We did get the opportunity to visit the store itself. A beautifully done brownstone style walk up in the heart of Boston. A very quant vibe, it would be a place I'd love to stay for hours. Everyone there was so nice and accommodating. Not your typical bookstore, a must-see if you have any interest in books or bookstores. I did get two I've been wanting to read.","Came here on a Thursday afternoon for brunch at around 10:30 AM. The place was booked until May, but we decided to try and walk-in. We couldn't sit inside but were quickly given seating outside. There was a heater and blankets, though it was still a bit cold! Decorations were so cute outside and I can imagine they're even better inside. Food was surprisingly really good. Their homemade sourdough that all the sandwiches are on is so crispy but chewy on the inside. We got their popovers, which were really herby, but came with this blueberry whipped butter that was to die for. Perfect appetizer to start with. I got their soup of the day, which was a \"chicken dumpling soup\", more like chicken and matzo balls but really delicious. Portion was pretty small. The sandwiches were normally sized though. I really liked the Franklin!","Such an adorable little book store! Their cafe wasn't open yet. But they have several stories of books for sale. Each floor has a different design. My favorite was the floor with the fire place and reading nooks. There's even a little children's area with a mini train model running along it's tracks.

I've been here about half a dozen times now, and I've had a chance to try their spices, tea, and (whole) bean coffee. If you're visiting Boston and wondering what to get friends, this place is a great start. The Coffee:A wide range of whole bean coffees, including dark and light, caffeinated and caffeine-free, robust and sweet. They can grind the coffee if you don't have a grinder. What i love the most about this place is that you can combine your coffee. I love a 3:4 ratio of maple nut with something darker. Some of my favs are the Maple Nut Crunch and Snickerdoodle, but they also have classic flavors like Italian Dark Roast and French Vanilla and coffee from Africa, Indonesia, Columbia, Costa Rica, France, and of course Italy. They have other fun flavors like Pecan Rum, Butterscotch, Chocolate Coconut, and Chocolate Raspberry. Even with flavors I haven't been a huge fan of, you can tell the beans are great quality because of their low acidity; coffee here is the kind of coffee you can drink black or with a splash of cream to cool it off. I believe they do a minimum of 4oz, which makes quite a few cups of coffee for one or two. The Spices:This is the place you should go if you want to cheaply refill spice jars, instead of constantly buying new jars. They have pretty much any spice you can think of from cinnamon rolls garam masala to lavender to peppercorns. The Tea:They also have loose leaf tea! I'm not a huge tea drinker, but i like that i can get a few ounces of tea to try here. And my tea-drinking friends have enjoyed the tea I've purchased for them here. I like the Hawaiian Sunrise and Peach teas I've tried. Sooo aromatic, with a generous amount of dried fruit.I also want to say that the workers here are super helpful every time i have questions about things, and more than happy to offer suggestione for you. I love this place so much that i plan on visiting every so often once i move just to pick up coffee.","Love love love me some Polcari's! It's a small shop but BIG impact. We walked in while visiting the area and when you first walk in you have the sweet savory smell of coffee.....like you just opened a fresh bag of coffee you know that first whiff? That's it. The staff was super friendly and explained you can buy coffee that they make (pour overs, nothing to fancy) but also have the option to purchase coffee, teas, spices, candies, olives, oils and more. With the coffees and teas they have them in big glass jugs that you can smell the flavors and choose how many pounds you would like to purchase. We purchased snickerdoodle beans (they can grind them for you as well), cinnamon beans, cinnamon orange tea, lemon pepper seasoning, smoked paprika & lemon ginger chewable candies. The smells are very much there and we made our first cup of snickerdoodle coffee at home and it tasted exactly like a snickerdoodle cookie. Luckily you can order online on their website so I will gladly make more coffee so I can order some more. 10/10 highly recommend. Even if you don't live in Boston check out their website as they do ship. Woohoo!","Believe the hype: their lemon slush is the stuff of dreams at this little coffee shop. Such a surprise. They hand it to you in a little paper cup and you just down it like a beast in 80-degree weather. Would come back here again and again when in Boston.5 stars!!!","Hands down the best coffee joint in the North End!I've tried several places in the North End's area ever since I moved here and found that Polcari's Coffee provides the most consistently satisfying coffee. My go-to is the iced house blend with no cream and sugar for whenever I need a little extra energy in the day. I'd recommend that to any coffee drinker looking for an all-around taste profile that sits evenly between acidity, bitterness, sweetness, and sourness.","The absolute best I have ever had. We walked by. We were so intrigued and thank goodness we walked in. This traditional coffee shop has history and a legacy. The guys that work there also take their coffee seriously, which was welcomed. We ordered an iced coffee and an espresso. They were wise to not water down my espresso as an Americano. The iced coffee is OUT OF THIS WORLD. I will forever miss and crave this until I return. I wanted it one more time before leaving Boston but they were closed on a Sunday. Please try this neighborhood spot!","A pretty cool Italian coffee store. They had many of Italian items. They had so many different types of coffee beans. They grind them for you. There were 2 super nice guys in there. A few regular customers came in while we were there to wish them a happy new year. You can tell these guys were well liked!! We got some goodies.","This is heaven. An eclectic assortment of spices, coffee and other Italian imports. Very nice staff who was helpful. Great place for all your coffee needs. Get an espresso and browse to your hearts content.","The smell along will bring you into this place ! Super cool coffee sport in the heart of Boston! On a recent trip we were wondering the streets and stumbled on this place because of the smell! Super chill place with vet knowledgeable and fun workers who know about coffee! This is not your Starbucks where you can get tons of sugary drinks! No this is just straight up good ol coffee- and tons of varieties ! Definitely a cool spot to check out if you visiting Boston!","This is a fantastic coffee shop featuring excellent coffees and teas from around the world. The antique scales they use are over 100 years old and still working completely fine. It seems not much else has changed about the store either, aside from the fact that they now allow you to tap your credit card to pay for your coffee.","Polcari's should really be your go to spot when you visit the North End! The shop is very cozy and a like a candy store - if your candy is spices, and interesting snacks! Drinks wise - definitely swing by for their espresso and lemon slush during the summer. Its all very fresh and very worth your time to take a stop here!","1.2 miles away from Polcari's Coffee","0.2 miles away from Polcari's Coffee"],"averageScore":0.7302352941176471},{"id":"8ziWlShyQE-L_EtqXYiHjw","name":"Cocorico Boulangerie","image_url":"https://s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/0kp7ieNkMWHbI-eQVeXS5w/o.jpg","url":"https://www.yelp.com/biz/cocorico-boulangerie-boston-2?adjust_creative=jwV6sY1jtf2pWAyq1ig0sQ&utm_campaign=yelp_api_v3&utm_medium=api_v3_business_search&utm_source=jwV6sY1jtf2pWAyq1ig0sQ","categories":[{"alias":"coffee","title":"Coffee & Tea"},{"alias":"breakfast_brunch","title":"Breakfast & Brunch"},{"alias":"cafes","title":"Cafes"}],"location":["450 Summer Street","Boston, MA 02210"],"comments":["450 Summer Street","Boston, MA 02210","3.9 miles away from Cocorico Boulangerie","2.0 miles away from Cocorico Boulangerie","Yelp users haven’t asked any questions yet about Cocorico Boulangerie.","Your trust is our top concern, so businesses can't pay to alter or remove their reviews.

They're custardy on the inside and crispy on the outside thanks to their glossy caramelized shell. I think they overdid these a little because it was more burnt tasting then I remember but these have the signature crunch and soft center. A tasty quick pastry! Their indoor displays are beautiful though with both sweet and savory bites. They have plenty of cozy seating in front of their in-hotel cafe and give off a pleasant atmosphere. I'd recommend a visit if you're staying at the Omni!","A few friends wants to go to a nice coffee shop for brunch. What we didn't realize was this was more like a coffee bar in a hotel lobby. If your looking for a place to hang out, this is not it. However, if you are looking for a good pastry, these are great. Definitely on the pricy side but worth it.","The croissant was one of the best I had. It was really well made. The crust was crispy and the inside was sweet. It was well balanced with a warm cup of coffee. There were not that many seating area but the service was good. The area was a bit noisy because it was close to the entrance door. I would not recommend studying here but good for socializing.","This was a great place to have inside the hotel.  The 2 sandwiches I had here were delicious.  Even if not staying at the Omni, you can access it from the street.  Don't be shy about trying the sandwiches out!","This boulangerie has a morning menu (from 7-11AM) and a lunch menu (until 3PM). It is only a small part of the lobby inside the Omni hotel, and there was a long line on the weekend. Despite the small counter and table space, it has a relatively big kitchen behind the doors.I think the roasted chicken sandwich was well worth the wait. I never had poulet in France (yet) but I could see this being an ancestor of the banh mi. Biting into the savory richness is messy, and likely even better with coffee. I originally wanted to try their breakfast sandwiches, but honestly I've been thinking of coming back to order the same poulet.","First of all, thank you to Yelp reviewers for drawing my attention to this coffee shop:  I never would've sought out a hotel coffee bar otherwise.I stopped by for breakfast this morning on the way to a conference at the convention center across the street. 1. The chocolate croissant (\"pain au chocolat\") was excellent.2. The latte was FABULOUS, possibly the best one I've had in my twenty years of drinking coffee. I'll be back for sure!--------------------An update after returning for lunch:The chicken salad was delicious and came on a warm, but not dried out, croissant. The staff were efficient and friendly during both visits.May I give this business 10 STARS?","This adorable coffee shop is inside the Omni Hotel. The coffee was delicious (not overly roasty) and the pastries looked amazing.  There were a mix of sweet and savory breakfast treats on offer, including one with tomatoes and feta. There are a handful of seats adjacent to the cafe, and you can also enjoy your beverage in the hotel's well-appointed lobby.","This place is on the first floor near the elevators of the Omni Hotel in Boston. I was there on the morning of the 10th of December. I purchased a 12oz cappuccino and a croissant. The cappuccino was decent and the amount was plenty for breakfast. The croissant was flaky and it passes the European-pastry high level quality. Breakfast cost me about $11 which was not cheap but it was convenient.","While Cocorico's Instagram and Cocorico Yelp display great-looking pastries and various baked goods what you get in reality looks very unattractive and unenticing. Everything is sloppily made... Instagram shows beautiful delicious croissants with bright red color stripes and in reality, they are all different shapes and sizes with unattractive pinkish color stripes... Was very excited when I saw the Image on Instagram with a large variety of beautiful croissants.  What you get in reality looks nothing like it. A supermarket-like quality at best... Extremely disappointing.","I come here regularly for the breakfast sandwiches and pastries.  They are truly world class and the service is equally impressive.","0.2 miles away from Cocorico Boulangerie","2.4 miles away from Cocorico Boulangerie"],"averageScore":0.6550526315789474}]
