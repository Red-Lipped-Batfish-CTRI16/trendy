        "This place is so cute and offers something new and unique in San Diego! We came with a big party and got a bunch of dishes to try but our favorites were the Cubano sandwich, mojo pork, and tallarin verde pasta. The cubano came out super fast and was warm and tasty. The bread was buttered and toasted very nicely and the sandwich itself had a generous amount of meat and veggies. The mojo pork came with a side of their caramelized plantains and white rice. The pork was very tender and seasoned very well and the sweet plantains paired nicely with the savory pork. The tallarin verde pasta was like a pesto pasta. The flavor was good but the chicken was the best part of the dish. It was very tender, crispy, and had lots of flavor. I would definitely recommend this place if you're looking for something new to try! We also got a complimentary drink at the end from our server Jaxon.",
        "This place was bbbussin. Jackson the best worker no cap. He was very nice! They got a llama in their logo. What is not to like?",
        "Great place for dinner on weekdays! Enjoyed the Lomo Salado and would highly recommend the yerba mate milk tea. Our server Lisa took care of everything smoothly!",
        "I get cravings for Peruvian food every so often, but haven't found a local place that has satisfied the cravings...until now! Plus, I love llamas, so that's a bonus! The inside is a large space, with very tasteful, bright and clean, with pops of color. You feel like you've transported into an indoor garden somewhere on the coast of the beautiful tropics. The music was very tasteful. The menu had an Asian/Cuban/Latin influence that was very unique. We ordered:-chicha morada (classic and not too sweet)-yuzu lemonade (refreshing and so good!)-fried yucca (crunchy, lightly seasoned, with delicious sauces)-perfectly caramelized platanos-ají de pollo (creamy with a slight kick)-tallarín saltado (the dish that I typically order, and it was cooked perfectly)The food came quickly and everything was out of this world! The service from Daniel was top notch! We will be back for sure!",
        "Craving some plantains, I decided to go to Flama Llama after a friend's recommendation. Daniel was quick to seat us and took our order.I was pretty hungry so I ordered the ropa vieja while my husband ordered the mojo pork. I also ordered the yuzu lemonade, but I would skip it if you don't like tart flavors. Although my husband loved the mojo pork, I felt that it was a little too salty but fortunately, the dish I ordered, ropa vieja, was just right if not a tad sweet. I also like that the portion was big enough for two as I was able to eat 2/3 of the plate before getting full. I will definitely be back to try their thai flan or spicy wontons.Parking: Plaza parkingPrice: $$Recommendations: Ropa Vieja and Plantains",
        "Fantastic service, Chris was super friendly and helpful. All the staff seemed great and Fresh green decor, lots of light and open space, so much better than most of the super packed and crowded restaurants in the area. The food was amazing, too! I could eat my weight in their chili wontons.Everything was excellent, we'll be back again and again!",
        '"A modern fusion kitchen with a fresh take on Latin classics"This place is new in the Convoy area and is marketed as a fusion of Asian and Peruvian flavors. For dinner I went with the arroz chaufa. Essentially a chicken fried rice that was solid, but I felt that it did not really incorporate any Peruvian flavors into the dish. It came with a side cilantro? based sauce which in my opinion didn\'t really complement or pair well with the fried rice. Decor inside the place is nice and the staff were super friendly. Parking can be tough in this area and the parking lot is on the smaller side so come prepared to look on a weekend!',
        "The Lomo saltado is so good. Definitely will be coming back for that dish with a request to kick up the heat.Tacos during happy hour.  Three juicy tacos w fried cheese and crisp fresh onion. Tasty and kid friendly. Great drinks and venue and service. The salad w corn, tomato and edamame was ok but not something I would order again. The pesto pasta and fried chicken were also in the tasty, good for little kids, but not something I would order again since the other dishes were better. Cubano was large generous and yummy.Would return and need more green sauce in my life.  And definitely the lomo saltado... soooo goodParking was easy and venue easy to find.  Come check them out!",
        "Long awaited Latin American fare from the owners of Steamy Piggy and Formoosa. I haven't had a chance to try many spots in San Diego, but Peruvian food is one of my favorite cuisines.Parking is limited as in most of Convoy. Spacious dining area inside. We dined at a weird time (late afternoon - in between lunch and dinner hours) so we were one of only a few parties. I can't speak for how busy they can get.We tried the lomo saltado (must), mojo pork, and side of chopped salad. The lomo saltado was our favorite dish. If you're looking for an \"authentic\" dish, you might not find it here. Their dish is more Chifa - the fusion of Peruvian and Chinese food. It was a generous portion and lined with delicious fries. The mojo pork also delivered great flavors but the maduros were not as caramelized as I prefer them to be. And lastly, the salad was refreshing and loaded. It was not my favorite salad but my partner enjoyed it a lot.Overall, we enjoyed our food but the prices are steep for a casual restaurant that delivers fast service.",
        'Most folks know that when Chinese immigrants came to California for the Gold Rush, they also brought with them their language, culture and of course cuisine.  Over the 175 years that has followed, Americans have grown to love Chinese food in both its authentic versions and its more westernized variants. Chop suey, General Tso\'s chicken and Mongolian beef are some of the better known adaptations that we love, but you would be hard-pressed to find in China. Less commonly known is that a similar phenomena also happened in Peru in the 19th and 20th centuries. Chinese came to THAT west coast as low-wage laborers, and brought their cuisine there as well. Unlike the US, however, the food that emerged was much more of a creolization of Chinese and Peruvian cooking. Chifa, as it is now known, is a fusion of Asian staples (rice, noodles, soy sauce) and South American vegetables, meats and starches. Chifa restaurants are as common in Lima as Chinese restaurants are in San Francisco.Outside of Peru, they are rather harder to find.  A couple exist in Los Angeles, a few in NJ and NY, and that\'s pretty much it.  Imagine my surprise to find Flama Llama here in Kearny Mesa! Although it is billed as "Peruvian and Asian Fusion" (with a bit of Cuban thrown in for good measure), the dishes served are definitely Chifa. So, for my first sojourn there, I went with a friend well-traveled in Latin America and we ordered a variety of dishes. We began with fried plantains, then moved on to the wonton soup. For our mains, I had the Ají de Pollo (chicken, egg and olives set in a mildly spicy yellow chile sauce) and he opted for the Tallarin Saltado (a noodle/pasta dish with flank steak, tomato and Asian flavorings). I washed my meal down with a sake, passion fruit and agave margarita, and my buddy had the chicha morada (blue corn juice). He confirmed for me, by the way, that these were indeed "authentic" Chifa offerings.And overall, the food was very good indeed. The plantains were extremely fresh, with a wonderful balance of sweet and savory. The sopa de wonton was by far my favorite dish: pork and shrimp wontons--extremely authentic--set in a wonderfully Latin chicken broth with scallions and cilantro. The only slight disappointment was my entree.  While quite flavorful, I thought the sauce itself was a bit heavy for the ingredients served.  This was more a matter of texture than taste. My friend spoke highly of his Tallarin.I might add the restaurant itself was very pleasant--bright, airy and casual--and the service in general was excellent. The one problem is parking. Although they have a number of spaces available, most of them are snagged by patrons of the restaurants and coffee shop in the next strip mall over. Prepare to park a ways away and walk.Having such a great experience with Flama Llama, however, I want to go back with and try some of the other options out there. This is a cuisine that is not an everyday thing, but it is unique to San Diego and well worth patronizing for the novelty alone. But beyond the novelty, these are flavors that appeal to a Californian population that is as eclectic as it is. Highly recommended.',

        "Our family did a late Christmas dinner here and it was superb!! The staff was so friendly, the place had a cheerful vibe and oh. my. goodness THE FOOD WAS SO GOOD! I got this fantastic lobster and white fish sandwich and my brother shared his lobster cheese and cheese - the best!! It was a really lovely night on the water. Thank you C Level Lounge!",
        "The food's amazing and the price is okay too. The place is great for friends to have some chit chat.",
        "Overall five stars. No doubt. Worth the visit. The ambiance is incredible. Right on the water. Very trendy. Service was amazing. Never went a second without something we needed. No dirty plate ever sat in the table. Cocktails were delish. Had the muddy espresso cocktail with mezcal. Loved the smokiness of the mezcal. Had the ahi tuna bowl - delish. The bre appetizer was incredible. Overall food was fantastic. Definitely worth a stop. Also gave us a free mudslide because we were celebrating a graduation.",
        "Our experience in this restaurant was not fully great. Drove 2 hours to SD to have a date night with my husband. We ordered lobster tail, my husband took the first bite and he felt something sharp. One of the staff came and we informed him that he almost swallowed this sharp piece of metal. He apologized and took our food back to the kitchen. When he returned he explained that it's from the steel brush they used to wash their dishes.The chef came and delivered a new labster tail to us, we thought he's going to say something after what happened to his food he cooked but he didn't. Just a blank stare to us then he left. Not planning to go back again in that restaurant.",
        "Came here for lunch and a quick refreshment.   I ordered the Burger and fries and a Bloody Mary.  The burger was delicious and Bloody Mary was amazing.  The restaurant was welcoming, clean with great atmosphere.  We had a wonderful view looking out at the water and surrounding area, good parking.Great overall experience at this restaurant, only negative were the cats that seem to wonder around freely throughout the restaurant.  I am not a cat person so right off it made me uncomfortable.  Luckily the wondering cats came at the end of my dining experience had I noticed them earlier I would have left the restaurant ASAP!2023(16)",
        "This place is amazing! We were able to get a table for two with really short notice on a Friday night. It was just kind of a last minute decision and it was a great one. We had the best table in the house out on the deck at the very far corner getting the whole bayside view of San Diego.The food and drinks were also delicious! I had the Fly Navy which had a chill citrusy-ness to it and my girlfriend had a Mai Tai which was an amazingly sweet pineapple bonanza that immediately transported you to an island paradise. I had the Lobster & Fontina BLT which was the best. Like a cold lobster roll inside a delicious BLT, a genius concoction. It also comes with some yummy Lobster Bisque that balances the cold with some warm. My girlfriend had the Crispy Tofu Bowl which was good but not great. The tofu was a little soggy, not a lot of flavor, and just a lot of rice.Our server was also awesome! We'll be back here :)",
        "My family could not have been happier after our experience here at C Level. I booked a dinner for my mom's birthday and it was a first time for everyone. The service from the staff was impeccable and definitely made my mom's night. We like to share things family style and they brought us dishes to try each others entrees. We all loved our food, however, our add on lobster tail was overly salty that day. The drinks are pretty strong in my opinion as well. Other than that, my favorite items from dinner was the filet mignon, ahi poke stack, and the mud pie! The steak is cooked perfectly and is accompanied by mashed potatoes and broccolini. The ahi they use for the stack is soft and goes great with the taro chips. The mud pie is a huge slab of coffee ice cream with chocolate cake and fudge! So decadent but so good. We had great views and were kept warm from the heaters all night. I am glad I chose C level to celebrate big events!",
        "Man!  I've been here many times but.   It's been a few years since Covid. and I forgot how great the menu was... HOLY MOLY it's was fantastic.  If the  unbeatable view isn't enough by itself.,,,the food! Gasp.... Muah! Fantastic.",
        "Man!  If the  view and ambiance wasn't enough to brag about alone..  The  food and cocktails will make you stay all night till closing.    Delicious food (every single time) and superb cocktails (I recommend the Martini \"Isle of Zen\" YUM! ). You won't be disappointed.    :-)",
        "First of all, I have to say this restaurant is definitely overrated. We reserve a table at 7:15 PM for Mother's Day because we want to eat a little bit early. However, we had to wait until 8 PM to get a table.For the food quality, this is definitely overpriced. To steak was overcooked. I will give 2.5/5 for food.Service is 3/5, they didn't do anything or say sorry for having us waited 45 mins even we made reservation. I think the view at night time was good but not amazing. Normal night view. I won't recommend this restaurant, not only for the delay, but there are tons of options with better for quality food.",

        "Love coming to Steamy Piggy for the Buns! They have a very Flavorful cuisine and a lot of good selections. My Favorite is the Steamy Piggy Ramen, and for those that like Spicy... they have an option for you too! Not only do they have Good Food, but their Servís is Great! Súper friendly staff and they help with any questions asked. Also, they're recommendations are spot on to what we (husband and I) were craving for. Don't miss this spot, the inside is very nice and definitely relaxing with some good Hype up Music!",
        "Came in on a weekday with my coworkers and this place got packed by noon! The food came as you order it so it's nice and fresh. The soup dumpling and fried dumplings were juicy and filling. The custard filled bao a was the perfect dessert to finish our meal. Parking: it was surprisingly difficult to find parking at 11:00 am on a weekday. There were only a few spots left",
        "Steamy Piggy is a really fun spot with some twists on classic Asian foods. Their menus had a wind range of different Asian foods with a twist... thing bugolgi fries or bugolgi tacos! They do have a wide variety of different ramens, and their dessert pig buns were super cute. I love the creativity in this place. The interior is filled with different plants. They are still serving foods in to go containers however you are able to seat and dine in. Service was fairly decent. I did go at lunch, and it took us some time to get a table even though there were open tables, just no host, but after we were seated, service was great!",
        "We dined here on a Saturday night.  The parking gods blessed us with a spot right out front, but there doesn't seem to be enough parking for the small strip mall where this is located.  We were lucky and seemed to beat the rush and only had to wait 5 to 10 minutes, but those after us seemed to have a longer wait.  The interior is small, but they do have a nice patio, which is where we sat.  Drink selection is a bit limited (both alcoholic and non), but two in our party ordered the Purple Rain and said it was good but a bit sweet - it is really pretty, though.We ordered the following for our party of 3, and it seemed like the right amount of food.Chicken roll - my favorite of what we ordered.  I also thought this was the most unique item we got.Soup dumplings- good but not amazing.....I thought they could use a bit more liquid, but the flavor was there.BBQ pork baozi- good but not super unique or memorable Bulgogi fries - these were very heavy on kimchee, which is not my personal favorite, but if you are a fan, I would recommendKawaii buns - cute but also tasty.  A sweet way to end the meal.While our meal was good, with so many great places nearby, I won't be rushing to come back.     However, if a friend wanted to try it, I wouldn't hesitate joining.",
        "It's a little hard to find and parking is sparce, but it's definitely worth the hassle. The staff were really nice and laid back, you seat yourself. They had a few indoor tables, mostly outside, which was great even on a chilly night, they had heaters going. Everything was soo delicious! Not pictured was a Scallion pancake we ordered just on the side and man was it so hot and crispy, soo good. The chili wontons were very tender and packed full of meat, perfect spiciness. We also really liked the bulgogi fires, though I wish there was more meat. But the fries were hot and crispy with tons of spicy kimchi and Shredded cabbage. The little piggies were cute and a nice not too sweet end to the meal!",

        "There's usually a wait outside so you know it's good! My friends and I ordered four of their braised entrees: two spicy braised short rib in stone pot and 2 of the sweet soy braised short rib in stone pot. We also ordered the braised pork belly with oysters. The braised entrees were definitely a hit as we saw many other tables order it as well. The spicy one is really good; to me it wasn't that spicy and I have an okay spice tolerance. If you're looking for something with a bit more of a kick I would recommend ordering this. The sweet soy braised short rib in stone pot was delicious as well! Both dishes came with potatoes and rice cakes along with the meat. The braised meet was so good--fork tender and juicy!! Full of flavor as well. It was so good to pair it with rice. Also, you could get the Korean side dishes as well! This was my first time trying the braised pork belly with oysters and my friend taught me how to eat it. She paired the napa with a slice of the pork belly, an oyster and some of the spicy squid and wrapped it all together in a small little taco. Then she ate it all in one bite! I tried it and it was really interesting. Most of my friends liked this dish but I thought that the oysters were a bit fishy for my liking and I do love oysters usually! also, the fishy taste combined with the pork just wasn't very appetizing in my opinion. However, my friends all thought that was really yummy so maybe it's just me! Conclusion: I'd come back for everything else but maybe I would not order the pork belly with oysters !",
        "I really wanted to like this place since we love Korean food and because of all the great reviews. Place is clean, we were seated right away for our party of 5.  Service was quick. Now as for food. It was just okay. We originally ordered the seafood pancake, cold noodles with galbi, and bulgogi.  We were told by the server that wouldn't enough.  We were hesitant to order more food but we did anyway by her recommendation.  So we added on octopus over rice hot pot and beef soup.  WAY TOO MUCH FOOD!! My first time trying cold noodles. It was interesting.  I was underwhelmed by the seafood pancake. My son mentioned the octopus had no flavor. However they did have a good selection of sides that were very good.",
        "Woomiok has been my least favorite Korean spot in San Diego. I just don't think there's as much flavor as people say there is. I am from Los Angeles where we have Ktown, so I have high expectations. I think if you're a tourist from LA, this isn't really for you.The galbi was on point. The portion was big, and the meat was hearty, but the bossam was not flavorful at all and very dry. The oysters they had came out of a jar, which is still good to eat, but it wasn't my favorite way to have them. The sides were also not well seasoned. The radish had the kimchi flavor but was soggy, indicating it had been sitting in the bin for too long. The Kimchijust wasn't good.Great service!All in all, I wouldn't come back",

This time, I'll give it a try!Two of us ordered No.8 on the menu-- they call it the Emperor's soup, and a seafood pancake. The portion sizes were very appropriate! Especially when combined with various delicious side dishes, it was a satisfying meal.The Emperor's soup contained beef, ox tail, and ox knee bones, as well as thin rice noodles. The beef soup itself was not seasoned with salt (or very little), so it didn't have much flavor. You had to add seasoning salt according to your taste. I'm not a big fan of drinking soup on its own, but it tasted much better when paired with rice.Now, let me emphasize the seafood pancake! Honestly, it's the most delicious seafood pancake I've ever had! It had large oysters, shrimp, and octopus tentacles in generous amounts. The pancake was perfectly crispy on the outside and gooey on the inside. The highlight was its savory and fragrant taste!Next time, I want to try dishes other than soup. I will definitely repurchase the seafood pancake!",
        "Such great seolleongtang restaurant in SD! Been wanting to try this place out since it opened and finally did after a few years!  Walking into the restaurant, it smells so good and it's bustling during the night. Kitchen was a little slow we ended up eating all our sides before getting our soup. I ordered the beef bone soup with assorted meats and a seafood pancake! The broth was so delicious and hit the spot for a cold night. Don't accidentally add too much salt or your soup maybe a little too salty. The seafood pancake was also delicious. It was crispy and also had great flavor even without the dipping sauce. Excited to come back for some good soup!",
        "Sweet Soy Braised Short Rib in Clay Pot, LA Galbi, Panko Breaded Fried Dumplings New favorite place alert! This was soo good, one of the best meals I had in a while. The short Rib in clay pot was such a highlight, especially the glass noodles. The short Rib was so tender and seasoned well. The glass noodles in the soy sauce was magical--definitely will order extra glass noodles next time! LA Galbi was fantastic--tender and flavorful. The fried dumplings we ordered on a whim and regretted---way too heavy haha! Large spacious interior, cozy and comfortable. Service is good--just make sure to ring the little bell to call the server over. Parking isn't bad in this plaza!",
        "SAN DIEGO, CA / KOREAN / 03-17-23 / LUNCH+The mixed seollongtang was delicious.+The kiddos enjoyed the panko fried dumplings.+Everyone liked the side dishes; e.g., spicy pickled radish and kimchi-The spicy beef guk bap had way too much red pepper flakes in it, which killed the flavor.What we ordered:'1 panko fried dumplings 13.99'1 mixed \"seolleontang\" beef soup 17.99'1 spicy beef soup 18.99'1 extra rice 1.00Total: $51.97 pre-tax and tip for a party of 2 adults + 2 little ones",

        "We went as a group yesterday. The service was great and friendly environment. We like their corn cheese. It was creamy, cheesy and buttery. So good. Also their chicken wings were well seasoned. They have different flavored chicken to pick from. Beside chicken wings, there are chicken sandwiches, waffles and chicken, kimchi fried rices, and side options like tater tots and fries. Great spot for a hang out with friends.",
        "One of the top 5 spots for Korean Fried Chicken in San Diego!! Went on a Thursday night and was able to make it just before dinner rush :,) Service was good. The portions are HUGE! I got so full from the 2 piece tender combo with fries. I get my tenders seasoned with soy garlic and lemon pepper fries. I love their corn cheese platter as an appetizer to share amongst a group. I also recommend getting their Lychee Soju and their Ube-beh (so creamy and doesn't even taste like alcohol). I only wish to have extra seasoning on the side. The workers said they weren't able to provide it. Parking can be a bit of a hassle because the lot is small and cramped. Plenty of side street parking.",
        "I thought it was pretty good. The seoul chicken was great with the green onion on top. The garlic parm chicken was good. I really like the texture of their breading. I would get something other than honey butter though. It was alright.There were fries in the corner that landed on our food so that was very unpleasant.",
        "One of the best korean inspired fried chicken in San Diego! I love their perfectly crispy and thin battered wings. All their flavors are phenomenal but my personal favorite is their garlic parmesan wings. Its perfectly garlicky with a good amount of parmesan cheese. They have a huge selection of soju cocktails and beers to choose from! Their happy hour is Monday-Friday's 3-6pm with some amazing deals. Their service was fast and brought out our drinks and food quickly. I really like the new booth seatings added to the restaurant. Their chairs are a lot more comfortable now, however, it can feel a little bit tight in there.",
        "Walked in around 4:30ish on Saturday was able to get a table within a few minutes. Staff was super attentive and friendly. Love that they have plant based options even for people who don't eat meat, that's always a plus in my book. Food came out quick, chicken was juicy and flavorful. I liked the touch of the chicken on the side of the fried rice. They have some cute and fun looking cocktails too.I'm honestly upset with myself it's taken me this long to try this place as it's been on my radar for quite some time.",
        "Pretty good food, hip environment and friendly service! My only complain was there were a lot of flies when we were sitting outside in the summer, but hopefully they have fixed that issue.Food-wise, oh so good if you love chicken wings! I enjoyed their OG wings, which reminded me a bit of KFC. Also their soy garlic was good, along with their spicy Korean. Don't forget to order their kimchi fried rice too!The decor was hip and modern, and I like their bathroom design a lot actually. Make sure you use it before you leave lol.",
        "Last night while watching the Cooking Channel, my husband came across a show that featured Cross Street and we just had to try it.I absolutely love the Seoul Spicy Chicken and the Corn Cheese. Would DEFINITELY go back and get them again.  The chicken sandwich was ok but I wasn't overly stoked about it.The service was great and the restaurant was very nice. Might need more booths but the inside of the restaurant is on the smaller side.  The restaurant does have a cool vibe going for it",
        "I liked the soy garlic flavor very much , however, chicken was a bit dry for my liking. 4pc and fries combo was big enough to share.Very friendly attentive service.",
        "Learned about this place because of Tiktok! Arrived for lunch, restaurant was very vacant. We were greeted and sat right away which was nice.I LOVE korean fried chicken. I was very excited to try this place because social media had me sold. However, I did think the chicken was very dry. The fries were well seasoned, sauce wasn't very spicy. It was actually not very memorable. Felt like I just had food to fill up. Maybe I just wasn't in the mood.The other reviews on here however are superb, so I'm thinking my experience was just a one off. I should've ordered other things such as the corn cheese and the chicken sandwich. I'll probably come back to give it another shot.",
        "We got here around 8:40 pm on a Friday night and got on the waitlist, we were seated around 9:05. Our seat was outside but there's heaters so I wasn't cold. We ordered the Triple Dipper, which is a sampler of their potstickers, fries and spicy popcorn chicken. And the 10pc of wings in garlic parmesan and soy garlic for our main!Garlic Parmesan was my favorite, it's definitely savory. The garlic soy is a bit sweet for my liking but it's delicious nonetheless. They're not crispy per say but the fried skin is delightful. I thoroughly enjoyed everything. I absolutely loved dipping the spicy popcorn chicken in the potsticker sauce, something sour/vinegar-y in it makes the spicy more muted but still flavorful!",

        "Service was great, food was even better. Would go again. Waiter was super nice. Pulled Pork Sandwich",
        "Organized a backyard party for 20, and catering from local institution Phil's BBQ was an excellent choice (Joyce pats self on back ;)! Ordering was a cinch - Melissa was super helpful in suggesting menu adjustments such as using dinner rolls to make mini Broham sandwiches - and delivery was prompt (highly recommend this option over self pick-up, as Phil's custom, multi-compartmentalized truck ensures your hot items stay hot and your cold items stay cold).From BBQ chicken to baby back ribs to pulled pork, accompanied by Caesar salad, baked beans, and potato salad, my guests were happy campers! Only one negative, the potatoes were somewhat undercooked and consequently that particular tray was left mostly untouched by the end of the evening... 4.5 stars which I'll round up to 5 because everything else was just so good, but hope Phil's pays a bit closer attention to the doneness of its potatoes next time!",
        "The food isn't horrible but it's just basic. There are better bbq places out there. Also, driving down Midway and all you smell is Phil's, you don't really want to eat it. Even going to Target... the smell.... It lingers.  The service is always great. Everyone is friendly and always check on you. So if you want a fun experience and great service, go. Again, the food isn't horrible... just not the best I've had.",
        "Honestly I don't understand the hype about this bbq, I've had much better quality else where.The only thing I liked was the sausage dipped in the sauce.We got recommended the onion rings and it was really whatever, sonic has better flavorful rings.Maybe it was an off day It was pretty packed Restaurant was clean, staff was friendly.",
        "Phil's BBQ is located in Point Loma, SD, off Sport Arena Blvd, serving up some hefty delicious portions of BBQ at an affordable price and is the 2nd most reviewed business in the nation!We came here on a Wednesday just after 6 pm and waited in line for roughly 15 minutes. The line goes pretty quickly, so don't let the line scare you. While waiting, you can read the helpful, useful, cool Yelp reviews the restaurant has posted on the flat-screens or even browse the menu deciding on what to eat. The concept is pretty easy to order as to where you order from a cashier and are given a buzzer, and when the buzzer buzzes, you go to the large counter to pick up your food. There is a fountain drink station inside as well as a bar on the other side of the ordering counter. We went ahead and ordered a variety of everything from smoked chicken to beef ribs and the famous El Toro sandwich, which is a BBQ beef brisket sandwich. We even ordered a side of the onion rings, which came with 2 dipping cups of ranch. When you order your food, they will ask if you would like the BBQ sauce on the food or on the side, and when getting it on the side, they will give you sides of sauce. Did I mention how good the sauce is, though? It is a sweet light settle sauce that isn't to over powering and it compliments the meat very well. We were all shocked when the food was ready because the portions were huge, and the plates were just as big as your head! Everything was immaculate from the fresh cuts of potatoes made into fries and the enormous BBQ beef brisket sandwich to the fall off meat beef ribs.Overall, this restaurant is clearly 5 stars, and I can see why this is the 2nd most reviewed place in the nation! Service was 2nd to none, and the food was awesome! I'll definitely be back here again and try something new! Thank you Phil's for a lovely experience!",
        "We had a groom shower at work. We ordered catering for 16 people from Phil's Santee location. We had ribs, chicken, potato salad, beans and cornbread. The chicken were very tiny and the potato salad didn't seem like enough for 16 people. Our order came with 9 large sides, we opted for 6 potato salad and 3 beans, potato salad portion was not enough.The ribs were delicious though.",
        "The long-awaited SD dinner. The hour-long wait made me crave it even more and they delivered. We ordered the Baby Back Rib Half Dinner and added tri-tip to share between two people. It was plenty for us both. Even though we asked for the bbq sauce to be drizzled on top of the ribs, it only covered half of it but I actually appreciated the flavor of the meat on its own. The surprise factor for me was the tri-tip. This was a last-minute add-on but I would've had a big food regret had I not tried it. It was so tender and, again, so flavorful even without the sauce but this one was pretty much drenched in it. For our sides, we got cole slaw and macaroni salad which were both delicious and refreshing palate cleansers. I also tried a bite of the baked beans from someone else from our table and I was surprised that it wasn't that sweet. For dessert, we got the Homemade Cornbread with Maple Butter which they say is a fan favorite but I can only see that happening if it was served warm. That's not to say it wasn't delicious, but it was served in a to-go package and nothing was fresh so the butter just sat on top of the bread. The service though was amazing. They work fast and ensure that as soon as you order, you're able to sit and get your food. There's a variety of sauces and paper towels at the table so that you're prepared to dive into a good meal with no worries.",
        "I stood in line for about 45 minutes and waited 10 minutes for my food to arrive. And what can I say.. the food was very worth our long wait. I'm sure for a place as popular as this, the lines are always wrapping around. This location was so busy and lively!Our cashier was very kind and efficient when taking our order. Our order was just amazing and I'm pretty sure I'm in love with their onion rings and ranch!!",

        "We love the original Havana Grill in Clairemont and was very excited for the opening of this new location. Immediately, we were greeted by the friendly staff and invited into a modern, very trendy-looking space. There is a bar and neon signs as well as a cafe area if you're only ordering coffee/baked goods. We opted to dine in for lunch and ordered a few empanadas to take home as well.They have a solid cubano that makes it so I don't have to go searching elsewhere to get my fix. It's consistent and delicious. It's generous. And the plantain chips are nice and crispy. A go-to option.We also tried the arroz con pollo (chicken and rice) and it quickly became a top favorite of the dishes they offer here. SO much chicken (we packed a whole another meal as leftovers) and the rice was very fragrant and cooked well. It comes with some maduros and a side salad normally but you can request for some roasted veggies instead.To end, we couldn't resist a guava cheesecake from the bakery. It was creamy and not too sweet. We loved it.In summary, I've never had anything at Havana Grill I didn't love. Great service and food. Can't ask for more.",
        "Not bad for a new Latin joint in San Diego.Growing up in the East Coast, I was immersed in a variety of ethnic diverse food. Here in SD not so much so I'm very excited for this place.It's gorgeous inside - it's modern, hip, and very bright. The bar is attractive, shout out to Steve with his mixing skills.Food: I got empanadas, Cuban sandwich, and the arroz con pollo. Beef empanadas were delish, perfectly crispy. Cuban sandwich was a miss for me. The bread is too thick and dry. The Cuban sandwich I had in Miami was moist and more like a panini.The arroz con pollo is good but it wasn't hot (temperature wise) when it was delivered to our table. The rice is flavorful as well as the chicken. Drinks were good but I could hardly taste the alcohol.Overall it's a 3.5 star for me but they're just getting started so I'm hopeful it'll get better.Customer service was on point tho! Friendly and welcoming!",
        "The hubby and I were elated to see Havana Grill open up in MV.  We've been to the Clairemont location a few times and liked it, but the MV location has great vibes, a fun atmosphere, and a cute interior.  They are still going through the soft opening and working some kinks out, but the people at the register, servers, bartenders were all very helpful and upbeat.  My husband and I shared 3 empanadas and the Vaca Frita plate.  First of all, the OG beef empanada is on point, flavored well, crispy and so good.  We also tried the chicken and bean which my husband loved.  The beef empanada is superior in my book.  Next came the Vaca Frita plate which has crispy slow cooked shredded beef, plantains, a small salad, and beans and rice.  The meat was so yummy and everything paired very well together.  I washed it all down with a pineapple soda which was delicious and reminded me of the dum dum lollipop I used to eat as a kid.",
        "As a South Floridian, I think this place is pretty good and comparable to the Cuban food back in Miami.I got the Ropa Vieja; it was packed with great flavors and super juicy from the sauce. The rice wasn't salty or super oily like most Spanish rice, so I appreciate it very much. And typically, I don't like beans.....but their beans were really really frickin good. My only critique is the maduros (sweet plantains), I felt that they weren't cooked all the way or they weren't crispy enough but that's just how I grew up eating them. Overall, I'd give this place a 4.5/5.I do love the atmosphere and the look of the restaurant. It reminds me a little bit of Miami. Very vibrant and colorful. I will be coming back to try more of their menu items.",
        "I had The Classic Sandwich, as it's called on the menu, and a side of black beans.. The sandwich came with \"Roasted pork, garlic aioli, caramelized onions, cilantro, mojo*\" (Havana Grill, 2023) and a side of banana chips.The sandwich was good, but I was a little disappointed with the texture of the sandwich, specifically the roasted pork. The meat was over chopped. I was hopping for a large slice pieces of roasted savory pork, like their illustration promoted. The caramelized onions were delicious and the cilantro mojo was good. I like the garlic aioli, but it was a little heavy handed on the sandwich. The banana chips had good texture and flavor. I would however make sure that they are consistent with their seasoning. Some chips were seasoned and others were plain. The black bean were very good. They were cooked tender to the touch and had great flavors. Service was good. I sat at the bar and the two young ladies were very nice. There's inside and outside seating available.",
        "I was surprised to see this new location situated in Mission Valley Mall! I'm familiar with the Clairemont location, and I was enthused to see that they have expanded! In comparison to the original location, this place is more modern with elements of organic, which is shown through the hedge walls and wood elements throughout. As is popular with many restaurants,  there were some pops of pink neon signage adorning some of the walls. In contrast to the Clairemont location, this place has a bar, more display cases, and a menu that highlights their coffee! I love the fact that they have the wooden shutters along one wall, which is the same design element in the original location. As I walked in, I was greeted warmly with an employee who was sporting a fedora hat, lending to the Cuban inspired dishes that the restaurant offers. To place an order, you order at the counter and then find your table. You are provided a table pager so that they can bring you items to your table when your food is ready. Cool concept, but I think they need to get used to it since the waiters still had to look around for my table. Cocktail: Margarita. This traditional drink was executed well. It was refreshing, and it had the right amount of tequila. Citrus Grilled Chicken Breast: This was a big portion with two chicken breasts topped with caramelized onions. There was a butter sauce on the side, so I happily dipped my chicken breast in the sauce, and it was delicious! The chicken came with brown rice, beans, and plantains. Dessert: Caramel Flan. This was so good. It was silky and creamy with the caramel sauce  covering the top. Definitely a must return!",
        "Absolutely love the new location! We frequent the Clairemont location and saw that the Mission Valley one was coming and couldn't wait! Same menu as the original location but with more seating, full bar, more dessert offerings, plenty of parking, and a back patio that is opening soon. We got our usual plates of lechon and citrus grilled chicken and they were delicious as always. The chicken was perfectly seasoned and juicy and the lechon was tender. This new location is perfect for relaxing after shopping or picking up dinner to go. Don't hesitate to visit- you won't be disappointed!",
        "My wife and I visited Havana Grill during their soft opening and wow! Great vibe flowing through out the restaurant. The interior is incredible, the decor and attention to detail make the place come alive. The staff were all very friendly and attentive. I ordered a classic Cubano and my wife ordered the vegetarian plate, both were delicious. There are a lot of items on the menu I want to go back and try. There is a great bar setup that has a list of curated cocktails too! We were stuffed so we didn't try the pastries and desserts but they looked and smelled amazing. This place is a perfect for date night, meal in between shopping, or drinks at the bar.",
        "I was Craving CUBAN food today, so we got ready to drive to HAVANA GRILL in Clairemont. Before driving, I went to check my last Review there, but when I was Typing HAVANA on my YELP I saw another HAVANA restaurant that popped up, and this one is at MISSION VALLEY. I immediately told my husband and son \"Let's go, I love Havana, for sure their new restaurant will have good food.\"When we arrived, I recognized a few of the staff from the other location that had been transferred here, I even said Hi to one of them. The place is nice and more open.The way to order here is the same as the other place, you will go to the Counter to order and pay, and then your food would get delivered to you. While we were in line I could could see their glass shelves full of Pastries and desserts, but I didn't order any sweets today 'coz I went for their main menu and ordered the same things that we ordered before from the other restaurant. We got: *SEAFOOD PAELLA - Shrimp, clams, mussels, calamari, cod, chicken, red peppers, peas, lemon, and rice.*RABO ENCENDIDO - Oxtail slowly Braised in Wine & Spices.*POLLO - 1/2 chicken, roasted garlic & herb house rub, and onions *LECHON EMPANADA *BEEF EMPANADA My PAELLA can come in 3 different order sizes, ranging from 1-3 people, I ordered 1 paella for 1 person 'coz my husband and son wanted something else on the Menu. The PAELLA that I got, as always, is the same as in their original branch, it's always good, the Rice on it was not Soggy, and I can really taste the Seafood flavor too in my Rice. My Husband's RABO ENCENDIDO, the OXTAIL, was very soft and so flavorful! My son's POLLO was also well-seasoned and very big. Among the 3 dishes I really like what my husband ordered, the RABO ENCENDIDO, it's very very Flavourful. As for the EMPANADAS, I wasn't impressed about them much, I know a better place to get good empanadas, their empanadas here are not bad, but not the best for me.I like their Location, it's by the MISSION VALLEY WESTFIELD MALL AREA , so after eating I get to go shopping!!! Both locations are good and both have good food!",
        "Perfect midday snack for a cloudy weather or any type of weather! Phenomenal service. Diana was the employee taking my order, she was light hearted, fun, and pleasant to talk to. Can't wait to try their dinner options :)",

        "Just finished my order from Mike's... seriously like 5 minutes ago, and I had to make sure i left them a great review! I haven't been to Cali in a year, and I look forward to good Mexican food every time I come, and I've got to say, Mike's has got the best authentic Mexican food I've had in YEARS! Great food, AMAZING taste, good value... OMFG, that was good! if there were a sixth star, I'd rate it at that!",
        "Best Mexican food I've ever had. If there was a 6th star that's what I would rate it.",
        "this was literally the best food i had in my whole life plz come here. such good quality and actually worth the price and makes u full.",
        "My hubby and I made a day trip to San Diego a few weeks ago and we were in the mood for some Mexican food. We ultimately gave Mike's Red Tacos a try and it was honestly the best decision we could have made. Probably now one of our favorite taco places in San Diego. Great food and efficient service. Definitely a place for any birria lovers.  Mike's Red Tacos occupies an intimate sized storefront in a small shopping center. There is lots of free parking shared among the businesses. If you can't find a spot right away, be patient as people are frequently moving in and out of the parking lot. As noted, their establishment is cozy with just enough room for patrons to form a line to order, wait for their food, and a few places to sit and eat in. We came in on a weekday at lunch and they were packed. Definitely a popular spot in the area. The staff is friendly and they work quickly and efficiently to meet the demand.My husband loves birria, so our order was plentiful. Tons of leftovers after the meal. Our order consisted of a:- Crunchstack- Red Quesadilla- Cali Burrito- Birria TacoAgain, all protein used for these item is birria, but Mike's Red Tacos does it well. The birria is tender, flavorful, and perfect with all of these favorite dishes. We really had no distinct favorite since everything was delicious. All of the dishes were generously packed with meat and the quantity was on point. The price definitely justified the product.We are big fans and cannot wait to return to on our next trip to San Diego.",
        "As always, Mike's is amazing!!Be prepared to share or bring your appetite!!We went around 7p, yeah a little late for kiddos, but the place was packed and busy!! The service was excellent, everyone was happy and willing to help!",
        "AMAZING! Added in my must return list Food: 10/10. Everything had great flavor! This Tuesday they offered a free taco when a combo was purchased. They tacos were so yummy and came with chips. The ramen was quite good, i don't think it was for me but it did have excellent flavor :) got my moneys worth with how large my portions were Place itself: there is limited seating so just keep that in mind when going with a group! Tables were clearing up pretty quickly as well. The staff was so sweet and they were a great team! Brought out food to us quickly too, so fast It's a Nice lil place to try, can't recommend enough- your SD newbie :)",
        "This tiny taco shop draws a huge crowd!They specialize in everything Birria.Service is quick and tables are limited so be sure to plan ahead and bring a friend to save a spot or take your food to go.If you decide to take out, find a park to chow down because your food will get soggy. Their salsa bar has really good options, spicy, super spicy and spicy af!Portions are huge and their food is delicious.A good size of dipping sauce and lots of the extra fixings if you purchase the plate. Be sure to always add the cheese. Worth it even if you're lactose lol. Side note, food so good even Crips will C Walk to eat here! I'll be back for sure if in the area.",
        "My immediate thought was noticing how small the restaurant is. There are about three small tables and one longer one. It is very crowded and there are no bathrooms. Their birria tacos are made with beef and very good. Consommé could be more flavorful. They have a good salsa bar, but again it's very crowded. I like how crispy the chips are. Service is fast. Overall would come here again but get takeout.",
        "I'm not a birras person, but it was pretty good! I got the Cali Burrito and it was pretty impressive! Place is tiny and the staff is super friendly! I definitely recommend!",
        "I have been wanting to try this place since hearing it made Yelp's top 100. Finally got in on a Sunday afternoon. It was quite busy - all the tables were full and there was consistently a line. The line does move quickly, which was good.Pros - Salsa bar with options for all spice levels, super friendly guy taking orders, huge burritos Cons - seemed to be having confusion getting orders ready, tables were not getting cleaned between customers, only a few chips with comboAs far as food, we felt it was ok, but nothing extraordinary. It tasted ok, but man, later we just felt bloated. Didn't get sick or anything...food was just heavy. I can see the appeal with the Instagramable dishes, but I probably won't go back, as I have a great birria spot closer to my home.",

        "It was friends birthday this past weekend and we made reservations for a group of us here. When we arrived, we were seated right away. Once seated, we were greeted by our server Nicole. She went through the specials and got us started with drinks. I ordered the Spring Envy. She described it as refreshing and it totally was! The basil and lemon with the gin was really well blended. Most of the group ordered the Flor De Piña. From reading the menu, it seemed that it was a spicy margarita with aperol and pineapple. I think they assumed ancho reyes, which is listed in the description, was a pepper. Once they got their drink they realized, it made the whole cocktail taste like a mezcal drink. It had a very smoky taste. Nicole was so nice to switch out their drinks and get them a couple spicy margaritas.I ordered the rigatoni bolognese and really loved it! My friends also liked the bucatini amatriciana and the ricotta agnolotti. We ordered Parmesan fries for the table. I can't wait to come back and try their pizzas!",
        "If you are reading this, order the bucatini and add that egg.I really enjoyed my birthday dinner here. The food was delicious, service was good, and it was overall really great experience. I am only nitpicking here, but the presentation for the plates were a little sloppy as they were brought out to us. And I didn't like the sangria, but I would still come back.",
        "Too salty Pizza, pappardelle, and octopus. Wouldn't come again. Got to go.Looked like fancy place inside",
        "I booked about a week in advance for the dining room, otherwise you'd have to sit outside (which is not particularly special) or at the bar. The ambience inside was urban and pretty classy. Our server was very attentive, kind, and gave us great recommendations. For the food, the squash blossoms were excellent and I would definitely get them again. We also got the rigatoni bolognese and clam linguine. They were good, but not anything too special. My cocktail, the Bella Rossa, was very delicious! It has a red bell pepper taste to it which was interesting but it worked well. The lemon cake dessert was sweet, had a meringue on top, and was topped with roasted pistachios. It was super yummy and the lemon custard was great. Overall, I'd come here again but I'd try different pasta dishes.",
        'It is hard for me to give a five to anyone because I feel almost everything, every one, everywhere has SOME kind of opportunity. This was close though... I\'ll say it was a 4.7  We made reservations for the patio but when we arrived it was really chilly outside so I asked if we could be moved indoor. They were all booked up so she suggested the "pizza bar" seating which is a high top open seating bar like setting right near the stone pizza oven. We went for it and it was perfect!Our server, RICHARD, was really what made the night. He was attentive without being annoying. He had a great sense of humor, was extremely knowledgeable on the menu and also about the history of some of the wines! He had great suggestions and parings for food and drink choices! He was awesome and really was excellent! 10/5!!We started with the fried blossom. It came with 3 pieces so our sever suggested to order a 4th so we both got 2! Great idea. They were my least favorite item we ordered that evening. 3/5. Warm, the stems cooks perfect, but really pretty bland over all. The focaccia bread we also ordered. It was fresh and warm. The butter was perfect room temp but could have used either some hens or some honey... bc the bread itself was rather bland too. Cooked perfect but needed "something" to dip in. 4/5My husband ordered the potato gnocchi. It was very good. A smaller plate for sure. Very unique in flavors and presentation. The gnocchi melts in your mouth. The lamb was tender but a bit more could be in the dish. The flora were fun and fresh. 4.5/5 I ordered the mushroom and caramelized onion with goat cheese pizza. It was cooked right in front of us. It was good but VERY rich!! We felt the topping could have been spread a pit rather than plopped all in the center. The first few bites are a bit over the top, then as you get too the crust there are none. It was good, but I could only eat one piece. My husband had 2. 3.5/5All in all, the service, ambiance, and food were a great experience. We would return and definitely sit in richards section!',
        "I will admit.. I'm writing this review before even receiving the entrees I just ordered. BECAUSE efff the entrees I was SOLD immediately at the Lime with Tito's appetizer! IYKYK.. ask Matt (our fabulous server. Even though he cut me off of limes)Luckily, in the midst of my app consumption, the squash blossoms came out and blew my mind! Please do yourself a favor and order extra sauce on the side because . Carving into the Foccacia as I type.. looking promising! Anyways- 10/10 recommend! (See pics below of the lime Tito's app).",
        "Amazing, amazing, amazing! It's been weeks since I visited cucina Urbana and I am still thinking of their pasta!! We had a wonderful time and service was great. Parking is a little tough so we parked a few blocks away and walked up. Reservations are a must, and you need to specify if you are preferring indoors or outdoors. We were seated outdoors and even though it was a chilly night, the heaters worked really well.The cocktails were inventive and amazing! I love a French 75, so I had their take on it. It was lovely. They also have a super impressive wine selection. The service is phenomenal, our waiter was really funny and attentive even though it seemed like he was handling all of the outside tables. Best of all, the food was STELLAR. I wish I lived closer, I would come here a lot more.",
        "I am puzzled by the stellar reviews...I was hyped by the reviews and the look of the food and so I made an open table reservation for yesterday night. All looked well when we arrived and I really appreciated the staff accommodating us for an outside table when my open table reservation wasn't until 7:30. The restaurant looked like there was plenty of seating, but I did note that by the time we left a little after 7, there were multiple parties waiting outside. We tried two appetizers - the fried zucchini blossoms and the octopus. Both were very good. I liked the zucchini blossoms better - $15 for three pieces, served with a lemon aioli and pesto sauce and stuffed with ricotta. We had also ordered the foccaccia ($9) and I used that to sop up the sauces. Highly recommend. The octopus ($20) was well done - crispy from the grill but also tender. I wasn't a huge fan of the beans they came with or the strange black flecked aioli, so I would not order this again. We also had the chopped salad, which was tasty. Lots of toppings in it and fresh, with the right amount of dressing. It wasn't very large, so we easily shared it amongst the three of us.The final items we got as mains were both pretty disappointing. First, we had the margherita pizza ($20). I wasn't as insulted, but my brother was very disappointed by the pale crust and half risen dough. We just thought all the pizzas looked like that, but after dinner we passed by other tables, and they had pizzas that had a lovely brown, bubbly crust that you knew came out of a wood fired oven. Ours was blond and sad, with little leavening or flavor in the crust. Our pizza could have come from a completely different restaurant.We also got the bucatini amatriciana ($22?), which was honestly, kind of weird. I'm not an aficionado by any means, but the bucatini was super overcooked, and we suspected the guanciale was too. The dish honestly tasted like stir fried Chinese noodles in a tomato or ketchup-based sauce. Think Hong Kong style food. Not offensive, but not at all what we expected from an Italian restaurant. I was super disappointed as I had been really craving Italian and we made a point to come here rather than go to Little Italy, where I had also been unimpressed.It's a beautiful venue, and though we sat outdoors because I had my dog, the inside was lovely. Our server was excellent so there were great things about this place, but the food was not the highlight. I would characterize it as pricey for what you get; I'm from Hawaii, and while Hawaii is definitely NOT known for Italian, I do think I know a few places I could have eaten better.",
        "This restaurant becomes one of my favorite Italian restaurants in San Diego!!! Firstly, the interior design and atmosphere are so modern, beautiful and comfortable. I love the vibe. The foods here are well displayed and very well cooked. All the things we ordered are delicious! I highly recommend the lamb shank, mushroom & truffle pizza, and short rib pasta, we also loved the Parmesan fries a lot. The cocktails are delicious as well, I loved my red sangria very much. We definitely would love to come back for more delicious foods and drinks! By the way, the service is amazing too.",

The lava chicken is my go to but I've had everything from their lumpia to Kalua pork and it's all good. They offer catering trays and Homestyle is my go to for parties or events. The day after my wedding, we catered Homestyle and had trays of rice, mac salad, katsu and pancit.",
        "Ok Hawaiian food? + 1 star for dole whip My fam and I came here on a Sunday evening for dinner. It was pretty busy, so we were excited to try it out. There were a few tables to eat on, but I saw a lot of people ordered take out. Note there are not many vegetation options here.First off, the lunch plates are huge and SUPER filling. My husband and I ordered 2 plates and ate them for 3 meals. The taste of the food is only ok. I ordered the shrimp scampi and was disappointed by the rice (which is usually my favorite part about Hawaiian garlic shrimp). I think the garlic was too raw for my taste. The mac salad was ok, not my fave. I think most things were just too heavy for me. For dessert, we got the dole whip w tajin and chamoy. Not surprisingly, it was a huge. We shared between 4 people. That was delicious and sweet and tangy. Yum and highlight of the meal!",
        "Second time visiting this restaurant for Hawaiian food. It tasted better to me this time than the first as the portions seemed much larger and filling. We ordered two spam musubis and a 2 item entree which consisted of lava chicken and Korean chicken. Both chicken items each included their lava sauce. The service was great and there is a bit of a wait but the food came out delicious! Would highly recommend to locals or anyone coming through SD.",
        "The dinner rush I guess is around 7pm, between the phone orders and walk in orders, it could take awhile to get your order in and to have it ready. Even so, it's worth it to us as we oftentimes just want some musubis and a scoop of mac salad for a light meal. You can customize your musubi if you do not like the traditional spam one, but I highly recommend the spam one. The other options include teri chicken, teri beef, katsu, or Portuguese sausage. The katsu one was a bit drier in my opinion because compared to the spam one, you don't have that nice grease and salt taste sinking into the rice for a delicious, balanced bite.",
        "Such a cute hole-in-the-wall mom-and-pop Hawaiian restaurant. Watch what time you go because they tend to close fairly early. But that was fine with me, because I like enjoying my early dinners around 5:30 after a tiresome workday. They have most everything you can think of that is stereotypical Hawaiian dish. I generally stick with kahlua pork or a loco moco. I was ecstatic to see that you can select the protein of your choice for the loco moco instead of getting the default burger patty, so naturally I got a loco moco with kahlua pork. They give you generous helping of rice per plate (close to 3 scoops) and macaroni salad. I was in food heaven when I cut into my eggs and watched the yolk soak into my kahlua pork. For dessert, try their dole whip! It is maybe $1 cheaper than Disneyland and the Dole plantation in Oahu, but the texture is slightly icier than usual. Otherwise, still a fantastic meal all around. One major downside - they don't offer water, you would have to purchase a drink. Another major downside is the severe lack of seating and AC, so I had to stop eating my loco moco about a third to halfway through to order the Dole Whip to cool down. These shortcomings though are easily overlooked with their fantastic food, and of course, can always be avoided by ordering to-go!",
        "I had their teriyaki salmon at work and it was delicious! Had to check out the source so here's my experience checking out the actual spot.AMBIANCE:Parking: Plaza parking, room for maybe about 15 cars.Seating: Inside seating for maybe about 4 groups.Vibes: You're close to Mesa College and a local high school, I can see this place being a gem for students. It's close to a lot of apartments and other eateries so the place isn't really too fancy. The spot itself is nice and welcoming. I enjoy the island music playing in the background, minimal decor, and articles about the restaurant. Great place for a grab-and-go, catering or lowkey dine-in.FOODBig Braddah Combo - (Recommend)Chicken katsu (Lava Chicken), Kalua Pig & Kalbi w/ rice and mac! As an indecisive person, I enjoyed this mix. The katsu was crispy and juicy, the pig was moist and well-smoked, and the ribs were sweet and delicious; the only problem is that it only came with one (sigh of sadness). Finally complemented with a side of mac salad just brought nostalgic memories of my trips to Hawaii. I enjoyed the smooth creaminess of the mac salad, it wasn't too peppery or excessive. Fried Musubi (Recommend)Awesome! It's more than deep fried but they put some subtle extra love and creativity. You have your classic musubi (Spam, rice, seeweed wrap) but the it rice seemed to be mixed with savory flavors of egg yolk. Finally a delicious deep fried batter and crunch topped with sriracha mayo. Ninja Turtle (Recommend)Lots of flavors to choose from but the pomegranate, pineapple, and lime mix stood out. I enjoyed the medley of flavors as it was sweet and tart at the same time.CUSTOMER SERVICE: Noah was awesome.  Energetic, friendly, and knowledgeable with the menu. It was a pretty busy time but he handled things calmly and professionally.TL; DR OVERALL: 4.5 stars. Awesome! Solid menu, good food, and all at a reasonable price. Yeah you can go to the chain L&L's but this stood out with subtle flavors and extra care. Their Dirty Sodas are unique along with their deep-fried musubis. I can see why this place is loved my locals, I look forward to coming back here for more of their ono grindz (delicious food). Mahalo to Homestyle Hawaiian and the rest of their team! TIPS: * Check out their other locations!",
        "This was our first time at this location, hopefully it was just today but the food was not good. We got the chicken teriyaki plate, 2 chicken teriyaki masubi, and the garlic shrimp scampi plate. The chicken was way over cooked so it was hard to even cut.... The shrimp had no flavor what so ever, it actually just tasted like they gave us shrimp in water. We ended up just throwing the shrimp away. The only thing we enjoyed was the rice, pasta salad, and The Hula Girl drink. The service was amazing though, everyone was very friendly! The food was just highly disappointing, especially because we know what it's supposed to taste like.",
        "Order and pay at counter. Find a spot to sit and wait.Mainly came here for the Garlic Shrimp Scampi plate as I've been craving for garlic shrimp. Got the Deep Fried Spam Masubi as well as it looked good.- Garlic Shrimp Scampi plate : It was ok. They give a food amount of shrimp. The mac salad was good. - Deep Fried Spam Masubi : Looked better than it tasted. It felt like it was missing something?Portions and presentation was good.",
        "Service - seems like this place is currently experiencing short staffing. We failed on our first attempt to eat here on a Sunday as they closed two hours earlier than normal because they were understaffed. Would've been nice if they gave a head's up on Instagram since they're active there anyway.We went back on a Wednesday and ordered through their Toast Tab in advance and we still had to wait for almost 30 minutes (45 minutes at this point from when we placed the order) and I think this is mainly because there's only one guy cooking everythingAmbiance - there's a small dining area outside with just high stools but I think people go here mostly for to-goThat all said, the food was AMAZING. We loved everything we got.What we got:Spicy shrimp scampi - shrimp is huge, meaty, and that spicy garlic sauce is just perfect. If I were to order this again, I'd just skip the mac and do double rice.Korean chicken - we thought this would be saucy but it's just glazed. It was a little bit of sweet and salty. My fiance liked it.2 Deep fried spam musubis - this is like eating deep fried sushi and we love it!! The sauces on top aren't too overwhelming.Malasadas - plenty serving. These simple malasadas don't have any filling like those you can get from Hawaii but they were amazing. I think the batter itself is delicious! Eat them while they're hot.All for $55. A little pricey but that's San Diego for you. Portions are big though. We'll be back!",
        "The food here is straight fire. I got the lilikoi lemonade, Malasadas, and deep fried spam musubi. 10/10 recommend. The staff was friendly and you can tell they put love into the food. You will not regret going here!",

Make a reservation ahead of time- very nice and attentive workersThe food:- definitely on the pricier side of $$ but it was very delicious! - I reccomend the indian butter chicken and the onion rings. The batter on the onion rings is so light and crispyThe environment:- SO PRETTY! They change their decor based on seasons and right now it's a spring theme- Perfect place for photos",
        "Made reservations for a girls' night during the Spring Oasis, and it was so pretty! I'm glad we were able to make it before the theme change.The drinks were tasty & strong. All of the food that we ordered was good, except for the clams and linguine dish my bestie had. It was super salty.. we mentioned it to our server, who took it back to the kitchen.Other than that, everything else was perfect! Can't wait to see the next theme up.",
        "Great place, awesome ambiance, superb decor, great for bringing family and friends.  Love their Italian breakfast with mimosas.   Staff is usually great.  They need to up their coffee game.  Just black coffee with cold milk.  Today I asked for warm milk with the coffee for my mom and they said they couldn't warm the milk.  ‍‍. So I went next door and got her a latte.",
        "After the pandemic, this place has really elevated the service and the dishes.  Great patio ambiance with the waterfall in the middle, nice dishes, good variety, ok selection of wines.  The staff is super friendly.  Their Nutella-filled donuts are my favorite. This place is great for drinks, dinner or brunch.  The prices have gone up significantly though, like everywhere else.",
        "Very limited hours and service.  Went there on a Sunday August 22, 2021.  Kitchen closes by 4pm so, we really couldn't order anything but drinks.  Last call was 5pm.  We had to walk out while there was still sunlight to look for another place to eat.  Good place for a drink and meet up but nothing else for the moment unfortunately.  I hope they come back as it used to be.",
        "-excellent decor-excellent drinks, awesome wine list -great local beer from HBC-excellent bartender-love the music and the waterfall-takes forever to get a table, the girls really need to up their game and be as polite and nice as the bartenders-not enough barstools at the bar-the food is ok. -the reception is not accommodating at all.",
        "I lived in San Diego for so long and literally just found this place a couple weeks ago. Shout out to Instagram. What caught my eye is the decor! They do a fabulous job of decorating the restaurant! I was thinking just cause it looks cute hopefully the food is good and the food was just amazing! The Caesar salad was just as good with the filet mignon. I would have skipped out on the meat/cheese platter. Of course everywhere I go, I judge the server. I think customer service is everything and if you have a bad server your experience will not be enjoyable. Our server was Julian and he was just as fabulous as the restaurant. Thank you for being welcoming and warming. I definitely will be back",
        "If you're looking for a fun, lively spot to enjoy some great drinks, snacks, or dinner, insideOUT is definitely worth checking out. From the moment you step inside, you'll be surrounded by colorful, eye catching cute decor that perfectly captures the spirit of spring.One of the highlights of insideOUT's menu is their charcuterie board, which is perfect for sharing with a group or enjoying as a light meal on its own. The board comes loaded with an array of delicious meats as well as an assortment of cheeses.To wash it all down, there are plenty of delicious cocktails to choose from. We ordered from the spring specials cocktail menu and they were delicious and cute!Overall, insideOUT is a great spot to visit if you're looking for a fun, upbeat atmosphere and delicious drinks and snacks. The spring-themed decor adds an extra wow factor to the experience and is super cute and instagrammable!",
        "Checked out InsideOut for its spring themed decor, and it did not disappoint! Loved the cherry blosson trees! This is an adorable bar/ restaurant for girls' night or dinner nights!We sat in the \"open seating\" section, which is dispersed among 4-6 levels of seats, surrounded by beautiful flowers and trees.  Disclaimer: You can only order drinks in the open seating area; a server will come to you, or you can also order directly from the bar.We eventually put our name down to sit for dinner. We didn't wait more than 10 minutes, given it was 10 of us, i was impressed!We ordered some apps to share as well as the short rip and pasta.They also have some seasonal cocktails I recommend trying while they last!This is my 3rd time to InsideOut, and each time, it feels like a new experience with the change or decor and drink specials. I will continue to fall there seasonal decor changes to plan my next visit.",
        "Overall I'd give 3.5 stars. Food nothing really stood out except the hot honey pork belly appetizer and desserts we got. The pork belly was cooked perfectly and the donuts and hazelnut torta were very tasty. The Bolognese was probably the best thing our table ordered and the onion rings were great. The burger was mid and the butter cauliflower was okay, the sauce was great but the salad and rice were not the best. Portion size was small compared to the price. Cocktails- the cocktails were okay- nothing really stood out from the specials we got for their spring oasis event. Their freaky tiki off their normal menu was my favorite and very refreshing. We also had to send back one of the cocktails as it was just way too sour and none of us wanted to drink it. Service was very slow. We came probably at the tail end of the dinner rush and our server was nice but we were without water a lot of the time and long periods waiting for the check and asking for more water. Ambience is where inside out shines. They've been decorating for the new seasons like Valentine's and now spring. Lots of great photo opportunities and enjoy the scenery. They really make you feel like you're not in a restaurant. Overall this is a great place to grab appetizers and a drink, not sure I'd come back for the entrees.",
        "A great dinner in Hillcrest! Such a unique spot. I love that they change the decor for the season, so cute! Their cocktails are delicious and strong, and the food is super tasty! I highly recommend the brussels sprouts and rack of lamb! Service was great.I recommend making a reservation as it does get busy.",

        "Pelicana is relatively new Korean Fried chicken in SD. We ordered BanBan Original chicken wings: half original flavor and half garlic flavor wings. There are 18 pcs in total. The garlic flavor is amazing! A of sauce and the wings are still crispy inside. However, the original flavor wings without sauce are not seasoned at all not even with salt...So do not order without sauce!",
        "the food here is goodi really liked the freiré chicken, the fries, the sauces and the cheese balls and sticks.",
        "We came here on a Friday night around 6PM and were seated right away. Our server was very sweet and the man, who I'm guessing is the owner, was awesome! He kept checking on us and making sure we were doing good throughout the whole meal.We ordered the smoky hot chicken, cheese buldak, ddukbokki, and cheese balls. Everything was sooo good. My favorite was the ddukbokki. The portion was so big and it had that nice spicy and sweet flavor I like for mine. The chicken was crunchy even when drenched in the sauce. I wasn't that much of a fan of the sauce flavor but it was still good nonetheless! The cheese buldak was very flavor and chicken was super tender. The cheese balls were also good but not that much flavor and you only get a small amount. Overall, highly recommend! Great place to share a meal with friends.",
        "there's so many new Korean fried chicken places popping up now and pelicana has brought some competition! first off, parking is actually not a mess, which is already a huge bonus over other spots like cross street chicken or bonchon. service was fast and when I asked for a time estimate for my pick up, it was spot on. with that said, their flavors are pretty basic and it's a little more on the pricier side. I ordered 3 whole chickens to share and the price per piece broke down pretty well, but each piece was not the same size because it literally is the WHOLE chicken, cut up. there were drumsticks, thighs, wings, breasts, etc...and some were much smaller than others. everyone had their own preference in flavor, but I wouldn't stay there's anything outstanding about them. we tried garlic, signature, and soy. I think we'll try the plain, battered original next, and maybe some other side dishes!side note: hoping this is just a one time thing but my friend found a hair in his chicken...he thought it was just on the batter but when he tried to pull it out, it was actually... in the batter. I didn't see into the kitchen while I was waiting for the food, but this can be prevented and should not happen.",
        "We ordered a whole crispy chicken (half soy and half with signature sauce on the side).What I like: chicken was crispy, the soy flavor was good, they gave us the option to put signature sauce on the side, there was a call button for the service so service was quick, complimentary cabbage salad provided, wait was relatively quick on a Friday night for a party of two, the vibe inside was nice and funWhat I didn't like: soy flavor would have been better if it was a bit spicy, they didn't let us put the soy flavor sauce on the side, the signature sauce was not good, it took 25 mins to get out crispy chicken, we got ONE drumstick even though we ordered a whole, and parking is limitedI would recommend people to try it out but this was nothing mind blowing.",
        "The food is so good and the servers are so nice. The atmosphere is very fun in here too.Highly recommended!!!!",
        "Pelicana is for sure my fave spot for Korean Fried Chicken in SD now!! We tried the Crispy Fried Wings in the Signature and Garlic sauce. Both were incredible but my favorite is definitely the Signature sauce. The wings here are definitely more wet than other KFC spots in SD, but I love it!! The chicken here is so flavorful and juicy. The wings here are so large and not dry at all. For sides we tried the Fried Chicken Gizzards and Cheese Buldak. The gizzards were so crunchy and nicely battered. It paired well with the spicy sauce served on the side. The Cheese Buldak is a must try! Super cheesy and filled with so much chicken, onion, and bell peppers. I was expecting it to be super spicy but it was perfect, in my opinion. It gave me a slight kick but was still very enjoyable. Service is quick and friendly. This place gets crowded during prime hours. Definitely go on an off hour if you can. There is a small parking lot. Definitely recommend checking this spot out for KFC.",
        "Food:Giant and juicy portions of boneless chicken! We were surprised about the portion sizes here, bigger than other Korean chicken spots. And they came out fresh and steaming. The sauces were pretty good - garlic was so strong that it'll keep the vampires away for sure, and the hot spicy was more sweet than spicy to us. It's one sauce per order but you can order sauce on the side for a couple bucks extra. The difference between this place and the gold standard (bbq.chicken) is the sauce options.Service:We prefer the call button to be served, and this place offer that. We were greeted and treated nicely. We appreciate the prompt seating and service despite a busy Sunday afternoon. They provide a bone collection bowl and gloves too!Atmosphere:Very chill ambiance here. We were able to share a conversation and enjoy the music. Inside was pretty nice.",
        "Pelicana was my most favorite chicken joint back when I was in OC. I was so happy to see one opened in San Diego. In fact I have come to this location to eat a few times since they opened. Tonight, I placed an order for delivery through DoorDash, and got a confirmation message from the store. Not until 40 minutes later when my dasher came to pick up the order, he was told that my order was canceled.I then called the store and a lady told me that they cancelled my order cuz they were out of wings for the night. She even blamed it on me that she tried calling me a few times but I didn't pick up. But I did not receive any phone calls in the past hour, except for the call from my dasher! First, neither me or DoorDash received any info on this cancellation. Even if you weren't able to call me, but what about contacting DoorDash? Second, what kind of chicken joint runs out of wings three hours before closing time? Lastly, despite all these problems, not once did she apologize for the situation; all she said was \"Ok.\"This incident has really ruined our night. I hope management will look into this and train their employees on how to better respond to similar cases.",
